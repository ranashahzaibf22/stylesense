## How to Use These Documents

### For Implementation (NOW - Next 14 Weeks)
1. Read **FYP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md** cover to cover
2. Follow the Implementation Roadmap (Section 8)
3. Clone the 3 reference repositories as instructed
4. Set up your development environment
5. Follow the phased approach:
   - Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
   - Phase 2: Data & Models (Week 3-6)
   - Phase 3: Core Features (Week 7-10)
   - Phase 4: UI & Integration (Week 11-12)
   - Phase 5: Evaluation & Documentation (Week 13-14)

### For Defense Preparation (Final 2 Weeks Before Defense)
1. Read **FYP_DEFENSE_CHECKLIST.md** completely
2. Follow the Final Week Checklist (Section 9)
3. Prepare all diagrams (Section 4)
4. Practice the demo flow (Section 5)
5. Review all Q&A responses (Section 2)
6. Print the Quick Reference Cheat Sheet (Section 14)

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Do (For Passing Grade)
- ✅ Train Body Type Classifier from scratch (show training logs)
- ✅ Fine-tune Category Classifier (demonstrate understanding)
- ✅ Implement all 5 core FYP requirements
- ✅ Working demo of all major features
- ✅ Prepare comprehensive documentation

### Should Do (For Good Grade)
- ✅ User testing with 10+ participants
- ✅ A/B testing (AI vs baseline)
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Security implementation (JWT, RLS, bcrypt)
- ✅ Professional presentation

### Nice to Have (For Excellent Grade)
- ✅ Novel contribution (body type + weather + occasion integration)
- ✅ Published demo (cloud deployment)
- ✅ Extensive evaluation (quantitative + qualitative)
- ✅ Well-documented open-source repo

## Questions or Need Clarification?

Both documents are designed to be self-contained and comprehensive. However, if you need clarification on any section:

1. Re-read the relevant section carefully
2. Check the related sections (cross-references provided)
3. Review the examples and code snippets
4. Consult with your supervisor

## Final Note

These documents represent hundreds of hours of planning and are designed to help you achieve the highest possible grade. **DO NOT PROCEED** with implementation until you've fully read and understood the integration plan.

**Your success depends on:**
1. Following the plan systematically
2. Understanding the "why" behind each decision
3. Being able to explain every component
4. Practicing the demo until perfect
5. Preparing for questions thoroughly

**You've got this!** 💪

Good luck with your Final Year Project!
